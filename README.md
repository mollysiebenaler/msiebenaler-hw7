 BAIS:3300 - homework 7: web forms
 
The purpose of creating this web form was to continue learning HTML coding skills and github source code management skills. Additionally, creating web forms is a technical skill that will benefit me in my future career.

This form was created in alignment with the best practices for creating web forms to ensure users have the best experience.  First, a simple Arial font was chosen as it is clean for users to read.  Black text with yellow accents were chosen to complement the University of Iowa branding, but not be too hard on the eyes. The form is broken into several pages to keep users focused as they progress.  However, users can see which page they are on at the bottom to track their progress. The questions are also grouped among the pages to aid with focus as well: for example, the first page's questions ask about where students are from, the second page asks BAIS questions, and the third-page shifts to sensitive questions.

When asking sensitive questions about gender and race, users have the option to select all that apply.  They can also read about why the data is being collected, or opt to not answer if they prefer.  

To make the form accessible to all users, it passed through HTML5 and CSS3 validation, as well as the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool.  This means that it is accessible to all users.  When building the form, I chose to add alt text to the IOWA image at the end of the survey.  I also chose to use colors that did not contrast poorly together.
